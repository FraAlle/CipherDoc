# CipherDoc

This is the repository created for the solution we created for the challenge proposed by Internxt.

We choose to follow the same direction of the enterprise in order to keep the whole proyect completly open source.

# What is CipherDoc?
Is a proyect based on developing a text editor focused on the security and privacy of your data.

By using this product, you can not sacrifice privacy when you work with other people in a document.

# IMPORTANT
This is just a prototype and shouldn't be deployed yet in work environments.

# New structure of the proyect
